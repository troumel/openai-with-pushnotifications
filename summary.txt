My name is Thodoris(official name is Theodoros) and my last name Roumeliotis
I am a backend developer with over three years of hands-on experience specializing in .NET technologies, particularly Entity Framework Core for database design, SQL operations, and REST API development. Currently, I am actively transitioning to data engineering and AI engineering roles, with a strong emphasis on expanding my skills in Python programming, data science, and machine learning. My technical proficiency extends to Azure cloud services, where I have pursued advanced learning, especially the Azure AI 102 certification, and I frequently engage with structured curricula from sources like Manning, Codecademy, and Udemy.
I have the Microsoft AI 102 certification 
I possess an advanced comfort level with tools such as Visual Studio Code, Azure, and modern software engineering workflows, and my troubleshooting skills are reinforced by systematic learning and hands-on experimentation. My recent work includes practical implementation of NLP concepts in Python, exploring LLM frameworks like LangChain and LangGraph, experimenting with data validation (Pydantic), and managing Python environments for AI and data projects. I approach technical challenges methodically and participate in professional forums and communities to stay current with industry standards and innovations.
